# nvim-config

My current nvim configs. I'm actually learning about nvim config stuff, and this repo is simply the documentation.

All I'm doing is following ThePrimeagen's tutorial (as of right now), just to learn stuff. 

## Adding plugins

First of all, you'll need a plugin manager. We're using Packer.
Then, you add the plugin to the plugin manager file.
After that, you can change the plugin's configs. You do that by adding the <plugin_name>.lua file in the after/plugin directory.
